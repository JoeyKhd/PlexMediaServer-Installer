# Plex Media Server Installer

A small bash driven script to install Plex Media Server easily on Raspbian Jessie.

## Usage

 * cd *download directory*
 * sudo chmod +x pmsinstaller.sh
 * ./pmsinstaller.sh
 * let the magic begin
 
 From now on Plex will automatically start whenever you boot.
 If PMS crashes for some reason, you are able to restart the service from this script aswell. 
 
## Notes
 
* PMS will use port 32400 by default.
* This script could not be used to install PMS on a different flavor since it's Jessie only.
